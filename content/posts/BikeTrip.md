### 🏍️ Manali to Leh: The Ultimate Motorbike Adventure 🏔️

The Manali to Leh route is one of the most highly rated motorbike trips in India. We chose this iconic route, extending it further to Nubra Valley and Pangong Tso. Along the way, we crossed some of the world’s highest mountain passes like Khardung La, Baralacha La, Lachulung La, Tanglang La, and Chang La. The landscapes are breathtaking and get better with every day. Make sure to carry a good camera to capture these spectacular views! 📸

#### Trip Route: 
Manali – Jispa – Sarchu – Leh – Nubra – Pangong – Leh (1100+ KM)

#### Total Days:
Dates: 08.09.2018 - 15.09.2018 , Total 8 days

### 🚲 Bikes:

We had four bikes for six people: two Royal Enfield Himalayans and two Royal Enfield Classics. The Classics were equipped with luggage carriers for our backpacks and petrol cans. ⛽ It's crucial to carry petrol cans as fuel stations are scarce along this route. We had four cans and filled them whenever possible to avoid running out of fuel. The bikes were booked online in advance before reaching Manali.

### ⏳ Best Riding Season:
The route is only accessible for three to four months a year, often cut off by snowfall and landslides. The best time to ride is between July and September. We started our trip towards the end of the season to avoid the peak rush, which also helped us secure better deals on hotels and bikes. 🏨

### **🗓️ Day 1: Travel to Manali & Prep (08.09.2018)**

The only way to reach Manali is by road. 🚐 We took a flight to Delhi, then an overnight bus to Manali. After arriving, we went to the local market to collect our bikes and permits. 🛂 It’s important to arrange your permits in advance as NGT allows only 1,200 vehicles per day to protect the glaciers.

After prepping, we headed to Manali Mall Road for some souvenir shopping 🛍️ and picked up essential accessories like medicines, ropes, gloves, and small oxygen cylinders to ensure our safety at high altitudes.

### **🛤️ Day 2: Manali to Jispa**



We started at 10:30 AM for Jispa. The lush green valleys and towering mountains along the way are simply stunning. 🌄 After crossing Rohtang Pass, the descent was challenging due to ongoing road repairs. Riding along the Chenab River to Jispa, we were treated to beautiful riverside views. 

We initially planned to stop at Keylong but adjusted our plans based on local advice. After battling cold drizzle and skipping lunch, we finally arrived at Jispa by 6:30 PM. 🌧️

### **⛰️ Day 3: Jispa to Pang**

We left Jispa in the morning, enjoying the stunning mountain views. After crossing the high-altitude Baralacha La (4,890 meters), we stopped for lunch in Sarchu. 🍽️ The road to Pang was a mix of good and bad, with difficult stretches like the Gata Loops, but the scenery made up for it. We reached Pang around 6:00 PM, physically exhausted from the rough terrain and cold temperatures. ❄️

Pang offers minimal accommodations, but if you're a photographer, the clear night skies provide an opportunity for amazing star trail photography. 🌌

The road to Leh is well-maintained, passing through Tanglang La (5,328 meters), the second-highest motorable road in the world. 🏞️ The desert-like landscape with red and purple mountains is a sight to behold. After a scenic drive along the Indus River, we reached Leh by 3:00 PM and spent the rest of the day exploring the local market. 🛒

We started late, leaving Leh at 10:00 AM. After a scenic ride, we crossed Khardung La (5,359 meters), the world’s highest motorable road. 🏔️ Descending into Nubra Valley, we visited Diskit Monastery and the sand dunes of Hunder, where you can see rare double-humped camels 🐫.

We ended the day with a cultural dance program 💃 and a campfire dinner in Nubra.

Our day started early with a drive to Pangong Tso. We crossed Chang La (5,360 meters), the coldest and most challenging pass of the trip. 🥶 Despite the cold and rough roads, the incredible beauty of Pangong Tso made it all worthwhile. 🏞️ After a brief stop, we returned to Leh via Upshi and concluded our trip with a farewell dinner. 🍽️

### 🩺 Health and Safety

Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a real concern when riding through high-altitude regions. There’s a good chance you might experience it, which can ruin your trip. So, please carry proper medications 💊 and get acclimatized to high altitudes before reaching the high passes. Two members of our team experienced AMS symptoms but were quickly cured after taking Diamox tablets.



### 🛣️ Roads and BRO (Border Roads Organization)

Some highlights of Project Himank, which maintains these incredible roads:

Approximately 80% of our journey was on well-maintained roads 🚧, thanks to the efforts of the BRO. While there were some challenging sections due to landslides and avalanches, the BRO works tirelessly, 365 days a year, to keep these roads open and safe for travelers. They do an amazing job! 👷‍♂️

### 🏍️ Bikes and Permits
