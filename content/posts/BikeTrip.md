### 🚲 The Bikes

![Our Bikes](Bikes.jpg)

For this trip, we had four motorbikes shared among six people: two Royal Enfield Himalayans and two Royal Enfield Classics. The Classics were fitted with luggage carriers to hold our backpacks and crucial petrol cans. ⛽ Given the scarcity of fuel stations on this route, carrying extra fuel was a must. With four cans, we made sure to fill up whenever we could, ensuring we never ran out of fuel in remote areas.

### ⏳ Best Season to Ride

![Our Bikes](season.jpg)

The Manali-Leh highway opens for only three to four months a year, often closed due to heavy snowfall and landslides. The sweet spot for riding is between July and September. We chose to go at the tail end of the season to dodge the crowds and snag better deals on hotels and bike rentals. 🏨

### 🗓️ Day 1: Travel to Manali & Trip Prep (08.09.2018)

The road to Manali was our starting point. We took a flight to Delhi and hopped on an overnight bus to reach Manali. On arrival, the first order of business was to collect our bikes and permits from the local market. 🛂 

With permits in hand, we explored Mall Road, grabbing essentials like medicines, ropes, gloves, and oxygen cylinders. High altitudes demand serious preparation.

### 🛤️ Day 2: Manali to Jispa

At 10:30 AM, we hit the road for Jispa. The lush valleys and towering mountains had us in awe. Crossing Rohtang Pass was exhilarating, but the descent was challenging due to road repairs. 

Following the scenic Chenab River, we skipped lunch and arrived in Jispa by 6:30 PM, tired but thrilled with the day’s ride.

### ⛰️ Day 3: Jispa to Pang

We left early, tackling the Baralacha La pass at 4,890 meters. A quick stop at Sarchu for lunch was a welcome break before tackling the rough roads to Pang. The Gata Loops were tough, but the stunning scenery compensated for the effort. By 6:00 PM, we reached Pang, tired but eager for the next leg of the trip. The night sky here is a photographer’s dream—perfect for capturing star trails. 🌌

### 🛣️ Day 4: Pang to Leh

The road to Leh was a smooth ride compared to the previous days. Passing through Tanglang La, the world’s second-highest motorable pass, was a highlight. We reached Leh by 3:00 PM and spent the rest of the day exploring the local market. 🛒

### 🏞️ Day 6: Leh to Nubra Valley

We set off for Nubra Valley, crossing Khardung La, the highest motorable pass in the world at 5,359 meters. Descending into Nubra, we visited Diskit Monastery and marveled at the sand dunes of Hunder, home to the rare double-humped camels. 🐫

### 🌊 Day 7: Nubra to Pangong Tso

We left early, tackling Chang La, the coldest pass on our trip. Despite the challenging conditions, the pristine beauty of Pangong Tso left us speechless. We paused to take in the breathtaking views before heading back to Leh for a final farewell dinner.

### 🩺 Health & Safety Tips

High altitudes come with risks like Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), so be sure to carry necessary medications like Diamox. Acclimatize well and be prepared—two of our team members experienced symptoms but recovered quickly.

### 🛣️ Roads and the BRO

Hats off to the Border Roads Organization (BRO), who maintain these treacherous mountain roads. 🚧 About 80% of our journey was on well-maintained roads, despite occasional challenges like landslides. The BRO works around the clock to keep these routes accessible.
