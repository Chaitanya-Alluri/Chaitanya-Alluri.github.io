### Introduction: Shifting Dynamics in Asset Taxation ðŸ”„

Taxation policies significantly impact the financial decisions of individuals and businesses. Traditionally, salaried employees have felt the burden of higher taxes compared to business owners, who often earn substantially more yet pay relatively less. This disparity has been justified by the government with the rationale that business owners are "risk-takers." The concept of risk has similarly been applied to asset classes, but recent changes indicate a shift in this philosophy.

### Traditional Taxation Philosophy: Risk-Based Classification ðŸ“Š

Historically, asset classes were taxed based on their perceived risk levels:

| **Asset Class**             | **Risk Level** | **Holding Period for LTCG** | **Tax Rate**                  |
|-----------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Real Estate, Gold, SGBs     | Low            | 3 years                     | 20% with indexation benefits  |
| Equity Mutual Funds         | High           | 12 months                   | 10%                           |

SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) allowed mutual funds to be categorized into various risk profiles. For example, overnight liquid funds were considered low-risk, while equity index funds were classified as high-risk. This classification supported logical taxation, where low-risk assets had higher tax rates and longer holding periods, and high-risk assets enjoyed lower tax rates and shorter holding periods.

### Recent Changes: A Paradigm Shift ðŸ”„

In a bid to simplify the taxation structure, the government has revised the taxation framework for assets, fundamentally altering the landscape:

| **Asset Type**              | **Risk Level**     | **New Holding Period for LTCG** | **New Tax Rate**           |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| High-Risk Assets            | High               | Same                            | Increased to 12.5%         |
| Most Low-Risk Assets        | Low to Medium      | Reduced to 2 years              | Aligned at 12.5%           |

Note: Most Debt related assets like debt MFs are still charged as per individual  tax slab rates.

### Conclusion: ðŸ“Š

The government's approach to asset taxation is witnessing a transformative shift, moving away from the traditional "risk" philosophy. The new strategy focuses on creating a simplified taxation structure. However, these changes raise several questions on taxation based on "risk" phylosophy:

**Increased Tax Burden on High-Risk Assets**: While the intent is simplification, the increased tax rate on high-risk assets could deter investors, potentially stifling market dynamism and innovation.
