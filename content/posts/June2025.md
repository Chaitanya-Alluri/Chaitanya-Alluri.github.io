It’s been a thoughtful couple of months. Between work, travel, and some much-needed downtime ✈️, I managed to dig into two incredible books — each powerful in its own way.

### 📚 What I Read Over the Last Two Months

I explored two profoundly impactful books — each tackling themes of ambition, survival, trauma, and the idea of “enough.” One follows a founder’s journey from coffee shops to billion-dollar boardrooms ☕💼. The other chronicles a Holocaust survivor’s path to healing and purpose.

Different worlds, yet both left me reflecting deeply on life, success, and meaning.

### 🤑 Never Enough: From Barista to Billionaire  
**by Andrew Wilkinson**

This book is part business memoir, part philosophical reflection — and all honesty.

Andrew Wilkinson, the founder of Tiny, takes us through his journey from slinging coffee to building a portfolio of tech companies. But rather than glorifying hustle or wealth, *Never Enough* offers a raw, introspective look into the emotional cost of ambition.

**What stood out:**
- The book challenges the glorification of the grind. Andrew admits how unchecked ambition damaged his health and relationships.
- He candidly explores the anxiety and dissatisfaction that can come even after "making it."
- There’s a powerful underlying question: *When do you stop chasing? What is truly enough?*
- If you’re in business or startup circles, many of his reflections will feel uncomfortably familiar.

**Why read it:**  
If you’ve ever felt like you’re constantly chasing — more deals, more success, more validation — this book offers a much-needed pause. 🛑 It’s a reminder that unchecked ambition can be just as dangerous as failure.

### 💔 The Choice  
**by Dr. Edith Eger**

This one hit differently.

Dr. Edith Eger’s memoir is raw, unforgettable, and full of grace. She was just a teenager when she was sent to Auschwitz. She lost her parents, her freedom, and nearly her life. Yet, *The Choice* is not just a story of surviving the Holocaust — it’s a story about healing, hope, and choosing life, again and again 🌅.

**What resonated most:**
- Her core message is simple yet profound: *We can’t change what happened, but we can choose how we live now.*
- She reminds us: *It’s never too late*. Whether you’re 16 or 60, there’s still time to start over.
- Her writing is deeply personal, yet universally applicable — whether you're healing from trauma or simply seeking perspective.
- The recurring lesson: *We always have a choice. Even when it feels like we don’t.*

**Why read it:**  
📚 *My take*: If you’re holding onto pain, stuck in the past, or unsure about the future — this book is your companion. It gave me perspective, and a sense of calm that’s hard to explain.

### 🧭 Final Thoughts

Two very different books — one rooted in ambition, the other in survival — but both had something in common: **they made me pause and reflect**.

- What does success really mean?  
- What am I chasing — and is it worth it?  
- What past pain am I still carrying, and how can I begin to let go?

Whether you're building your next big idea 🚀, healing from what’s behind you, or simply trying to make sense of where you are — I wholeheartedly recommend both books.

They won’t hand you easy answers.  
But they will help you ask the right questions.
