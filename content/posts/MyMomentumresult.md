Three years ago, I dipped my toes into the exciting world of **momentum investing** 📈. It began as a casual exploration—playing with strategies on Smallcase and testing index funds like the Nifty 200 Momentum 30. I was hooked, fascinated by the idea that stocks on an upward swing could lead me to profits. Then, in October-November 2023, everything changed 🔥. I discovered *Quantitative Momentum: A Practitioner’s Guide to Building a Momentum-Based Stock Selection System* by Wesley R. Gray and Jack R. Vogel[^1]. That book lit a spark 💡, pulling me into a deep dive of white papers from Alpha Architect[^2] and Rajan Raju[^3], each one stoking my curiosity and enthusiasm.

Together with my friend Masquer Sajjad, we decided to create something unique. After countless revisions 🌙, endless tweaks, and plenty of discussions ☕, we finalized our strategy by February 2024. I ran backtests and paper trades, settling on a portfolio of 15 stocks from the Nifty 150 universe. The results were promising—almost too good to believe. But paper profits are one thing; the real market is a different game 🎲. So, on **April 1, 2024**, we took the plunge, pooling our money to launch our strategy live for a one-year trial.

The first few months were smooth sailing 🌬️. The market was bullish, and we rode the wave with confidence. But I knew the real challenge was lurking—how would we fare when the market turned? That test came in late October. By February, the downturn hit hard, and it felt like wading through quicksand 🥳. Thankfully, March brought a much-needed breather—a historically strong month that didn’t disappoint. Looking back, I’m glad we faced both highs ☀️ and lows ⛈️; it made our system stronger.

## The Blueprint of Our Strategy 🛠️

Here’s the breakdown of how we did it:

1. **Stock Selection**: Our script picked 10 stocks from the Nifty 100 and 5 from the Midcap 50—15 total from the Nifty 150—based on momentum signals 📊.
2. **Rebalancing**: We refreshed the portfolio regularly, swapping out laggards for new winners 🔄.
3. **Exits**: When the signals turned red 🚨, we pulled out and shifted cash to debt funds 💼.
4. **Re-entry**: Once we got the green light 🟢, we jumped back into stocks.

It sounds straightforward, but the execution? That was a mental marathon 🧠.

## The Emotional Rollercoaster 🎢

Warren Buffett once said, *“Emotional stability always beats intelligence in investing.”* This year, I lived that truth. Managing my emotions was the toughest part. I’d get ahead of myself—jumping into trades too soon, chasing hunches instead of sticking to the plan. Those mistakes hurt 💔. Without them, our returns could’ve hit 24%. But each slip-up taught me patience, discipline, and the value of waiting when I wanted to leap.

The dips in October and February were brutal. Seeing the portfolio shrink felt like a personal blow 👊. Yet, following the system—exiting on time, holding off until the right moment—kept us in the game. Thriving in a bull market is easy; surviving the bears 🐻 is where you prove yourself.

## The Finish Line: Results That Shine ✨

On **March 28, 2025**, with the trading year done, I checked our Zerodha screenshot. The numbers made me grin 😊:

- **Nifty 50**: 4.69% for FY 2024-2025.
- **Our Momentum Portfolio**: 18.67%.

We didn’t just edge out the benchmark—we smashed it 🎯. We even outperformed active and passive mutual funds like the Quant Momentum Fund and the Nifty 200 and 30 Momentum Funds. This was more than a win; it was a victory lap 🏆. A year of hard work, doubt, and grit had paid off big.

## A Journey to Celebrate 🎉

This chapter of my stock market adventure has been incredibly rewarding. Beyond the 18.67% return, it’s given me confidence in a system I built from scratch and a solid plan for deploying cash when I’m between ideas. The emotional ups and downs—thrills in the peaks, stress in the valleys—taught me lessons no book could match. It’s a milestone I’ll cherish, filled with pride and a sigh of relief.

As I write this, I see it’s not the end—it’s a launchpad. I’m ready to tweak, adapt, and ride the next wave, hopefully with a calmer heart this time ❤️.
